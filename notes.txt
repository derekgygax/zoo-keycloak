The core concept in Keycloak is a Realm. 
A realm secures and manages security metadata for a set of users, applications, and registered oauth clients. 
Users can be created within a specific realm within the Administration console. 
Roles (permission types) can be defined at the realm level 
and you can also set up user role mappings to assign these permissions to specific users.

Definitions
  -Realm: A zoo branch (e.g., "Central Zoo") that manages its own animals, staff, and visitors separately from other branches.
  
  -Role: A job title at the zoo (e.g., "Vet", "Cleaner", "Admin") that defines what someone can do.
  
  -User: A person at the zoo (e.g., John, the vet) who is assigned a role and given permissions.
  
  -Client: The zoo’s website or app (e.g., "zoo-management") that people use to log in. 
    It doesn’t handle authentication itself but relies on Keycloak to 
    verify users and check their roles before granting access.
